A circle is 360 degrees. 
The sum of the numbers 360 is 9. 
Now if a circle is half, it is 180, and the sum of the numbers is 9. 
If a circle is a quarter, it is 90 degrees, and the sum of the numbers is 9. 
If this circle is divided into millions of parts, the number is 9 again.
Everything in the universe is a circle, even the universe itself! This is one of the millions of pieces of evidence that the universe was created from the numbers 3, 6, and 9, with 9 being the most basic number.
Don't be confused!This is the concept of existence that requires learning mathematics and astronomy. 
God doesn't exist! But the universe does!
